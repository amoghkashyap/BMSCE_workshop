    "### Python is a programming language, as are C, Fortran, BASIC, PHP, etc. Some specific features of Python are as follows:\n",
    "- an interpreted (as opposed to compiled) language. Contrary to e.g. C or Fortran, one does not compile Python code before executing it. In addition, Python can be used **interactively**: many Python interpreters are available, from which commands and scripts can be executed.\n",
    "- a free software released under an **open-source** license: Python can be used and distributed free of charge, even for building commercial software.\n",
    "- **multi-platform:** Python is available for all major operating systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X, most likely your mobile phone OS, etc.\n",
    "- a very readable language with clear non-verbose syntax\n",
    "- a language for which a large variety of high-quality packages are available for various applications, from web frameworks to scientific computing.\n",
    "- a language very easy to interface with other languages, in particular C and C++.\n",
    "- Some other features of the language are illustrated just below. For example, Python is an object-oriented language, with dynamic typing (the same variable can contain objects of different types during the course of a program).\n",
